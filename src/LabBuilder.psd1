## What is New in LabBuilder Ureleased

April 8, 2019

- Refactored module manifest generation process to be more reliable
    and robust.

- Removed `Timeout 30` from the Initial `SetupComplete.cmd` that runs
    on each VM when first intialized because it fails to execute on
    Windows Server 2019. Replaced with `Start-Sleep` in `SetupComplete.ps1`
    that is called by `SetupComplete.cmd` - fixes [Issue #308](https://github.com/PlagueHO/LabBuilder/issues/308).
